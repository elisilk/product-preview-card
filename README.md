## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- [CSS background images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background) - Used this to embed the product preview images in the background of the product preview container.
- [Alignments in flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Aligning_items_in_a_flex_container) - Continuing to learn about flexbox and how to make use of the various properties to control alignment of the flex items.

### Continued development

So much. Where to start? Definitely want to take on some more complex projects. And begin to include either a css preprocessor, multiple pages, or more JavaScript. Or maybe just more complex layouts that will need to be flexible for different screen sizes.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) - Of course, as always. So useful.
